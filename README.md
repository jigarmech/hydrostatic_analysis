# HydroStatic Analysis on components
A MATLAB application to perform hydrostatic analysis on components. It uses PDE_toolbox of MATLAB to perform hydrostatic simulation.
Shift the component to positive x,y,z and then import the stl file.
Install the file and later, a rectangular container stl file is uploaded to try out your first simulation. It works for me. So it should work for you.
